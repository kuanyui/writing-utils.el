;; [English] Enhanced minibuffer & find-file!  I cannot bear helm &
;; ido-mode's UI, but theirs some features are very juicy. So:

;;   1. If minibuffer contains a file path, M-[DEL] to delete back to
;;   parent dir
;;   2. Press C-a is the normal C-a, but when you press it 2-times:
;;       (a) if a file path, delete all except for ~/ or /
;;       (b) if not a file path, delete the whole line.
;;   3. Above actions won't pollute kill-ring. So feel free to use them!

;; [Chinese]
;; 加強minibuffer和find-file

;; 我實在無法忍受helm和ido-mode的find-file設計，但又覺得他們有部份功能
;; 實在很方便，所以：

;;   1. 如果minibuffer中是個目錄的樣式，按M-[DEL]就可以往前刪到parent dir
;;   2. 按一次C-a只是一般的beginning-of-line，但按第二次C-a的話：
;;       (a) 如果是個路徑，會把~/或/以後的東西刪掉。
;;       (b) 如果不是路徑，則整行刪掉。
;;   3. 以上行為都不會把刪過的東西存到 kill-ring，所以可以放心用力刪，
;;      而不用擔心會影響到目前的 kill-ring~
